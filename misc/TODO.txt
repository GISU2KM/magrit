TODO list:
- /!\ fix the zoom by rectangular zone
- Check for missing values before letting the user choose the field for choropleth / stewart /etc.. (as behavior dont seems to be the same on all browser)
- Do more data validation (client and/or server side) to avoid weird user-uploads + more testing on the join operation
- Choose some fonts (to be served by the server) to be used by the user (title, label, text annotation) instead of relying on the avaiables fonts in the current browser.
- Allow to move each label on "label map" functionnality
- Change the bar chart in the discretization panel
- Fill some fields with "first guess values" (Stewart span, etc.) and add limitations to some fields (Stewart resolution, etc.)
-(Fixed ?) Fix some undefined behaviors when trying to make a new jointure on some "edge" cases
- Package the R functions in order to facilitate installation (by installing directly required packages)
- Choose a solution for ui internationalization
- Upgrade js code to use d3.js v4 ?
