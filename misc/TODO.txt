TODO list:
- More testing on the join operation
- Check for missing values before letting the user choose the field for choropleth / stewart /etc ..
- Propose palettes instead of single colors in the styling popup when features have been already classed
- Let the user choose his own class (+ custom colors) in the discretization panel
- Do more data validation (client and/or server side) to avoid weird user-uploads
- /!\ reload preferences from the exported json
- /!\ zoom on the extent of freshly added layer (via the bbox returned by the --bbox topojson option)
- /!\ add an button to display basic informations on a layer (nfeatures, nfields, type geom, etc..)
- add functionnality to zoom on a selected zone (rectangle) drawn on the canvas by the user
- allow styling options (font, size, etc.) on the title ?
- add the simplification options ?
- implement some kinds of unit tests / tests suite (using python bindings for selenium?)
