TODO list:
- Check for missing values before letting the user choose the field for choropleth / stewart /etc.. (as behavior dont seems to be the same on all browser)
- Propose directly palettes instead of only reclassing in the styling popup when features have been already classed
- Do more data validation (client and/or server side) to avoid weird user-uploads + more testing on the join operation
- /!\ reload preferences from the exported json
- /!\ fix the zoom by rectangular zone
- add the simplification options ?
- allow to display label on rendered features ?
- Add some layout elements (cardinal arrow, scale, etc.)
- Fix confusion between layer pointed by the information cursor when layer order is modified while pointing for informations
- Keep trace of the last legend position, to redisplay it on the same place (only if colors are changed when a legend palette is displayed)
- Improve the "user defined" break values in the discretization panel
- Refactor broken selenium tests
- Allow the user to display label of features on its map (based, or not on some criteria)
- Only propose palette on styling box for stewart layer (or resend a query if the number of class is changed)
- Add a tooltip on freshly created layers (propsymbols, MTA) as on other layers
- Remove the "reverse palette" option on diverging coloramps
- Add an option in the "style" box in order to fill each features with a random color (instead just allowing to fill all features with the same color)
- Let the user choose the symbol max size on cartogram maps as on proportional symbols maps.
- Fix the (colored) legend on PropSymbolChoro in order to keep it updated when a new discretization is changed (as on choropleth)
- Double-check styling configuration for MTA results
