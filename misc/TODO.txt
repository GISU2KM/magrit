TODO list:
- /!\ fix reloading a project from previously exported one
- /!\ Choose some nice icons related to the fields data type (ratio, stock, category, unknown, id ?)
- /!\ re-allow the user to browse its imported (csv etc.) dataset ? (as the functionnalities was squizzed when moving the "browse table" button on each layer)
			or allow a preview (as the dataset aims to be joined to the targeted layer)
- Do more data validation (client and/or server side) to avoid weird user-uploads (also check xls/xlsx/ods files to warn if there is formula or multiples sheets)
- Make a fancy chart for selecting class and size for values quantization in discontinuities / links
- Design a favicon.
- Make a short documentation about how the project is structured in order to facilitate potential contributions
- Split the current repository in two repo. : one for the website and one for the application and its documentation.
- Add support for GML and geopackage format (input/output ? why ? why not ?!)
- Allow the same behavior when zooming on symbols as on arrows and ellipses
- Use some "caching" method to avoid recalculation of jenks breaks (partially done)
- Fix generation of labels layer from a discontinuity layer + allow to generate labels from prop. symbols layers.
