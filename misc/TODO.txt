TODO list:
- /!\ fix the zoom by rectangular zone
- Check for missing values before letting the user choose the field for choropleth / stewart /etc.. (as behavior dont seems to be the same on all browser)
- Do more data validation (client and/or server side) to avoid weird user-uploads + more testing on the join operation
- add the simplification options ?
- allow to display label on rendered features ?
- Allow the user to display label of features on its map (based, or not on some criteria)
- Choose some fonts (to be upload on the server) to be used by the user (title, label, text annotation) instead of relying on the avaiables fonts int the current browser.
- Make a "style box" dedicated to the label layer.
- Improve default displayed colors in the "categorical box".
