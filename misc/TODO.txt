TODO list:
- /!\ fix the zoom by rectangular zone
- Check for missing values before letting the user choose the field for choropleth / stewart /etc.. (as behavior dont seems to be the same on all browser)
- Propose directly palettes instead of only reclassing in the styling popup when features have been already classed (like with Stewart)
- Do more data validation (client and/or server side) to avoid weird user-uploads + more testing on the join operation
- add the simplification options ?
- allow to display label on rendered features ?
- Add some layout elements (cardinal arrow, scale, etc.)
- Fix confusion between layer pointed by the information cursor when layer order is modified while pointing for informations
- Keep trace of the last legend position, to redisplay it on the same place (only if colors are changed when a legend palette is displayed)
- Allow the user to display label of features on its map (based, or not on some criteria)
- Allow to explore the table of the result layer
