TODO list:
- /!\ fix reloading a project from previously exported one
- /!\ Choose some nice icons related to the fields data type (ratio, stock, category, unknown, id ?)
- /!\ re-allow the user to browse its imported (csv etc.) dataset ? (as the functionnalities was squizzed when moving the "browse table" button on each layer)
			or allow a preview (as the dataset aims to be joined to the targeted layer)
- Do more data validation (client and/or server side) to avoid weird user-uploads
- Make a fancy chart for selecting class and size for values quantization in discontinuities / links
- Design a favicon.
- Make a short documentation about how the project is structured in order to facilitate potential contributions
- Split the actual repository in two repo. : one for the website and one for the application and its documentation.
- Fix legend when using q6 discretization.
- Add support for GML and geopackage format (input/output ? why ? why not ?!)
