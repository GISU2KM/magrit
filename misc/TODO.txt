TODO list:
- Change the "tooltip" / info box to a nicer one
- Check for missing values before letting the user choose the field for choropleth / stewart /etc.. (as behavior dont seems to be the same on all browser)
- Propose directly palettes instead of only reclassing in the styling popup when features have been already classed
- Do more data validation (client and/or server side) to avoid weird user-uploads + more testing on the join operation
- /!\ reload preferences from the exported json
- /!\ fix the zoom by rectangular zone
- add the simplification options ?
- improved sample dataset box (make three discrete buttons to avoid current weird behavior when trying to add target layer + tabular + layout layer at the same time)
- allow to display label on rendered features ?
- /!\ Allow the user to choose layout elements (cardinal arrow, scale, etc.)
- Fix confusion between layer pointed by the information cursor when layer order is modified while pointing for informations
- /!\ Redraw directly the legend when the class limits are modified 
- Keep trace of the last legend position, to redisplay it on the same place ?
- Improve the "user defined" break values in the discretization panel
- Change the stroke drawing behavior when zoom.scale() is too high / Use two kind of "redraw" behaviour (with two svg elements ?), one two use with "zoom" behavior (for fast moving) and one other to use with proj.translate() (for more precise drawing on the user targeted layer) ?
- Extend selenium tests
