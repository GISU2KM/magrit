TODO list:
- Testing the join operation
- Do more data validation (client and/or server side) to avoid weird user-uploads
- /!\ reload preferences from the exported json
- /!\ zoom on the extent of freshly added layer (via the bbox returned by the --bbox topojson option)
- /!\ add an button to display basic informations on a layer (nfeatures, nfields, type geom, etc..)
- change the accordion behavior in the menu to allow more than one section to be opened at the time ?
- add functionnality to zoom on a selected zone (rectangle) drawn on the canvas by the user
- rollback to the original header
- better select the mouse behavior on orthgraphic projection (rotate or move but not both together)
- allow styling options (font, size, etc.) on the title ?
- add the simplification options ?
- avoid sending data (zip & geojson) as dataurl as it might be a bottleneck ?
