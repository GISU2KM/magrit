TODO list:
- /!\ fix reloading a project from previously exported one
- /!\ Correct many nonsenses due to the incremental way in which were added some features, aka "clean the code"
- /!\ Choose some fonts (to be served by the server) to be used by the user (title, label, text annotation) instead of relying on the avaiables fonts in the current browser.
- /!\ fix the zoom by rectangular zone
- Switch to CeCILL licence ?
- Handle correctly missing values according to the functionnality used
- Do more data validation (client and/or server side) to avoid weird user-uploads
- Add soem specials options for the garticule in the "stylebox"
- Improve the new "Textbox" class (in order to have the same behavior with chromium than with firefox)
- Make a fancy chart for selecting class and size for values quantization in discontinuities / links
- Allow the PNG export with a better resolution ? (currently it fits stricly the pixel size defined in "basemap options")
- Design a favicon
- (Partially done) Create an index page + Insert message about how cookies are used for EU visitors to comply with whatever directive it is
- (Partially done) Fill some fields with "first guess values" (Stewart span, etc.) and add limitations to some fields (Stewart resolution, grid cell-size, etc.)
