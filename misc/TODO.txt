TODO list:
- /!\ fix reloading a project from previously exported one
- /!\ fix the zoom by rectangular zone
- Upgrade js code to use d3.js v4
- Check for missing values before letting the user choose the field for choropleth / stewart /etc.. (as behavior dont seems to be the same on all browser)
- Do more data validation (client and/or server side) to avoid weird user-uploads + more testing on the join operation
- Choose some fonts (to be served by the server) to be used by the user (title, label, text annotation) instead of relying on the avaiables fonts in the current browser.
-(Partially done) Fill some fields with "first guess values" (Stewart span, etc.) and add limitations to some fields (Stewart resolution, grid cell-size, etc.)
-(Fixed ?) Fix some undefined behaviors when trying to make a new jointure on some "edge" cases
- Add soem specials options for the garticule in the "stylebox"
