TODO list:
- More testing on the join operation
- Remove the "explore your dataset" as a single functionnality (in order to allow the user to browse table on every other app functionnalities (stewart, choropleth, etc))
- Check for missing values before letting the user choose the field for choropleth / stewart /etc ..
- Propose palettes instead of single colors in the styling popup when features have been already classed
- Let the user choose his own class (+ custom colors) in the discretization panel
- Do more data validation (client and/or server side) to avoid weird user-uploads
- /!\ reload preferences from the exported json
- /!\ zoom on the extent of freshly added layer (via the bbox returned by the --bbox topojson option)
- /!\ add an button to display basic informations on a layer (nfeatures, nfields, type geom, etc..)
- add functionnality to zoom on a selected zone (rectangle) drawn on the canvas by the user
- allow styling options (font, size, etc.) on the title ?
- add the simplification options ?
- add a box to customize the legend (float number precision, title, etc.)
- improved sample dataset
- allow to display label on rendered features ?
- implement some kinds of unit tests / tests suite (using python bindings for selenium?)
- Pick a random color to fill the layer just added by the user (instead of always the same one)
- Fix the weird behavior when trying to move the legend
