TODO list:
- Check for missing values before letting the user choose the field for choropleth / stewart /etc.. (as behavior dont seems to be the same on all browsers)
- Propose directly palettes instead of only reclassing in the styling popup when features have been already classed
- Do more data validation (client and/or server side) to avoid weird user-uploads + more testing on the join operation
- /!\ reload preferences from the exported json
- /!\ fix the zoom by rectangular zone
- add the simplification options ?
- /!\ Allow the user to choose layout elements (cardinal arrow, scale, etc.)
- Fix confusion between layer pointed by the information cursor when layer order is modified while pointing for informations
- /!\ Redraw directly the legend when the class limits are modified 
- Keep trace of the last legend position, to redisplay it on the same place ?
- Improve the "user defined" break values in the discretization panel
- Refactor broken selenium tests
- Allow the user to display label of features on its map (based, or not on some criteria)
- Only propose palette on styling box for stewart layer (or resend a query if the number of class is changed)
- Apply the same transformation to the prop symbols points when the map is reprojected
