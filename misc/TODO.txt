TODO list:
- /!\ Choose some nice icons related to the fields data type (ratio, stock, category, unknown, id ?)
- /!\ re-allow the user to browse its imported (csv etc.) dataset ? (as the functionnalities was squizzed when moving the "browse table" button on each layer)
			or allow a preview (as the dataset aims to be joined to the targeted layer)
- Make a short documentation about how the project is structured in order to facilitate potential contributions
- Add support for GML and geopackage format (input/output ? why ? why not ?!)
