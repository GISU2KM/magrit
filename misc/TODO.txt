TODO list:
- More testing on the join operation
- Change the "tooltip" / info box to a nicer one
- Check for missing values before letting the user choose the field for choropleth / stewart /etc ..
- Propose palettes instead of single colors in the styling popup when features have been already classed
- Let the user choose his own class (+ custom colors) in the discretization panel (using a text area)
- Do more data validation (client and/or server side) to avoid weird user-uploads
- /!\ reload preferences from the exported json
- /!\ zoom on the extent of freshly added layer (via the bbox returned by the --bbox topojson option)
- /!\ add an button to display basic informations on a layer (nfeatures, nfields, type geom, etc..)
- add functionnality to zoom on a selected rectangular zone drawn on the canvas by the user (brush)
- allow styling options (font, size, etc.) on the title ?
- add the simplification options ?
- add a box to customize the legend (float number precision, title, etc.)
- improved sample dataset box (make three discrete buttons to avoid current weird behavior when trying to add target layer + tabular + layout layer at the same time)
- allow to display label on rendered features ?
- implement some kinds of unit tests / tests suite (using python bindings for selenium?)
- Pick a random color to fill the layer just added by the user (instead of always the same one)
- /!\ Fix the weird behavior when trying to move the legend
- disable the "render" button on choropleth maps until class / colors have been chosen
- Use two kind of "redraw" behaviour (with two svg elements ?), one two use with "zoom" behavior (for fast moving) and one other to use with proj.translate() (for more precise drawing on the user targeted layer) ?
- Display the result/rendered layer with a separate color from the targeted layer (like green and yellow, etc.)
- Allow the user to choose layout elements (arrow, etc.)
